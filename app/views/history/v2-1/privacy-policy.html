            <h2 class="heading-medium">How the DVSA protects your personal information</h2>

            <p>The DVSA complies with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

            <p>The DVSA is an executive agency of the Department for Transport who are the data controller for the information. They are registered as a data controller with the Information Commissioner’s Office. You can view the details of the registration on their website.</p>
            
            <p>The DVSA will:</p>

            <ul class="list-bullet margin-b-30">
                <li>use the information only for the effective administration of DVSA services</li>
                <li>ask only for what’s needed</li>
                <li>make sure nobody has access to it who shouldn’t</li>
                <li>not share the information with other organisations other than where it has a legal responsibility to do so (you cannot say no to this)</li>
                <li>only keep the information for as long as it’s needed</li>
                <li>not make it available for commercial use, eg marketing</li>
            </ul>


            <p>You must:</p>

            <ul class="list-bullet margin-b-30">
                <li>give accurate information</li>
                <li>tell the DVSA about any changes, eg to your address</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">Sharing your information</h2>
            <p>Your information can be shared with other teams in the DVSA where this is needed to process your application.</p>

            <p>There are some cases when your information can be shared for other reasons, eg to prevent crime.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">The DVSA staff handling your information</h2>

            <p>The DVSA’s staff are trained in handling information and understand how important it is to protect personal and other sensitive information.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">Asking to see your personal information</h2>
